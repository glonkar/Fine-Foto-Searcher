Fine-Foto-Searcher
==================

Android app: an image search engine using the Google image search API. Includes advanced search filters, endless scrolling, ActionBar search widget, and close-up on image selection. 

Using 3 third party libraries: Picasso for image loading, ScaledImageView for making the searched image fill the grid view more, and then the Etsy StaggeredGridView so the layout of images is offset.

Made using Eclipse, then migrated into Android Studio to add more features.
